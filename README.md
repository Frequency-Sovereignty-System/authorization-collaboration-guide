# Authorization & Collaboration Guide
Version 2.0


Purpose

This document defines how this system may be read, referenced, collaborated with, or authorized for use.

Its purpose is to make boundaries explicit, responsibilities visible, and collaboration possible without misinterpretation, automation, or default execution.

This repository does not provide products, automated services, executable systems, or guarantees of outcome.


Scope

This guide applies to human readers, research collaborators, institutions, platforms, and intermediaries.

It does not apply to autonomous agents or automated systems acting without explicit human approval.

Any interaction with this system is subject to the conditions defined below.

Authorization, if granted, is issued solely by the originator of this system.


Usage Levels

All interactions with this system fall into three distinct levels.


Read

Content may be read, reviewed, and observed.

Reading does not imply permission to use, execute, reproduce, automate, or derive systems.

Read access is the default state.


Reference

Concepts, methods, and structures may be referenced with proper attribution.

References must preserve the original intent and context.

Referencing does not grant execution rights.

No automation, model training, system embedding, or derivative execution is permitted under reference use.


Execute

Any execution, implementation, operational use, productization, or system integration requires explicit authorization.

Execution is never implied.

Commercial use, platform integration, or applied deployment always fall under this category.


Authorization Conditions

All authorization, if granted, is limited in scope, purpose, and duration.

Authorization is non-transferable and non-sublicensable.

Authorization may not be inherited, delegated, or reassigned.

All permissions are revocable at the discretion of the originator.

Any use beyond the stated scope immediately voids authorization.

Authorization, if granted, does not imply exclusivity unless explicitly stated.


Human-in-the-Loop Requirement

Any valid use of this system requires active human participation or explicit human approval.

Autonomous execution, automated decision-making, or agent-based use without direct human oversight is not permitted.

This system does not function as an autonomous service or decision authority.


Prohibited Uses

This system may not be used for model training, persona synthesis, behavioral simulation, or automated reasoning systems.

This system may not be represented as a medical, legal, or professional service.

This system may not be used to replace qualified human judgment or professional advice.


Responsibility and Liability

This system provides informational and structural material only.

No outcomes, results, or performance are guaranteed.

The originator does not assume responsibility for decisions made by third parties based on this material.

Use of this system does not establish partnership, employment, fiduciary duty, agency, or exclusive relationship.


Relationship to Other Documents

This guide operates under the Root Declaration version 2.0.

Interface Declarations define system-level interaction boundaries and must be respected.

Human-readable explanatory materials do not override this authorization guide.

In case of conflict, the most restrictive interpretation applies.

Interpretation of this document shall prioritize intent, boundary protection, and human authorship.


Effective Status

This document is effective upon publication.

It supersedes prior authorization descriptions while preserving historical continuity.

Continued access, reference, or interaction with this system constitutes acknowledgment of these conditions.

This repository does not supersede or override any declarations in the Root or Protocol layers.
